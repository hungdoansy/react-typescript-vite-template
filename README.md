This is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). This already has `ESLint@8.20.0`, `Prettier@2.7.1` and `Typescript@4.7.4` installed.

## Getting Started

My personal recommendation

```json
"engines": {
    "node": "^16.0.0",
    "pnpm": "^7.0.0"
},
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or (recommended)
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/App.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
